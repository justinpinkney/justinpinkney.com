# About Me

Iâ€™m Justin Pinkney and this site is my home on the web.

Most of the things on this website are either about Generative Art or Deep Learning or the combination of the two. Mostly written up as blog posts.

What was my hobby has turned into my day job as I'm a machine learning researcher at [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com) where I'm lucky enough to work on state of the art image generation.

You can also find me on other places around the web, say hello on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Buntworthy) (although I use it a lot less than I used to), or keep up to date with this site via [RSS](https://www.justinpinkney.com/feed/feed.xml) ([what is RSS?](https://aboutfeeds.com/)).
