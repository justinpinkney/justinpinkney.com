After seeing many amazing water drop photos all around the internet I tried out some quick attempts at droplet collision photos. Armed with a cheap speedlite, a tray of water, and a syringe it was actually fairly easy to get some decent splashes. It still takes a lot of lucky timing, and many failed attempts, so building an arduino controlled water dropper sounds like a pretty fun project and evidently leads to some [amazing](https://web.archive.org/web/20120531111427/http://www.photosbykev.com/wordpress/tips-and-trick/water-droplet-photography/) [pictures](https://www.scantips.com/shako/index.html). There's also an amazingly large difference between milk and water at these scales, but the shapes both make are incredible.
