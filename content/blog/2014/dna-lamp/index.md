A prototype of a stolen idea from a friend of DNA sequence displaying LED lamp.

My first with controlling addressable LEDs with Processing and the fantastic <a href="http://www.misc.name/#/fadecandy/" target="_blank">Fadecandy</a> board from <a href="http://scanlime.org/" target="_blank">Micah Scott</a>. Of course it would be way more fitting to have two LED strips and arrange them in a double helix...
