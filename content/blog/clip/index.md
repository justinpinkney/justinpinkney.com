_I realise that I all too easily fall into the trap of writing things on Twitter and thinking "I'll clean that up, flesh it out, and make a blog post of it.". But I never do. So better to break it out of the silo a bit first and then work on it later._

I'm excited about @OpenAI's CLIP, more so than DALL-E and it people are doing some really cool stuff with it (that's what happens when you release an amazing model!). Here's a thread to capture some interesting tweets.
