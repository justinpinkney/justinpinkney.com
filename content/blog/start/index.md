# Hello!

I'm __Justin Pinkney__ and [[this site]] is my home on the web.

Most of the things on this website are either about [[Generative Art]] or [[Deep Learning]] or the combination of the two. Mostly written up as blog posts but you can also see a [[stream]] of outputs and screengrabs of the things I've been playing with.

My [[day job]] is as a machine learning researcher at [Lambda Labs](https://lambdalabs.com/). I spend most of my time writing code, developing algorithms, training models, and encouraging people to embrace good software development practices.

I spend a lot of my free time messing around with code and here I'll write about some of it. Some things might even be called [[projects]] and hopefully [[all:the rest]] might still be of interest.

You can also [[find me]] on other places around the web, [say hello on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Buntworthy), or keep up to date with this site via [RSS](rss.xml).
