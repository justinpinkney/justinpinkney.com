## Midjourney

I work as a machine learning researcher at Midjourney, working on state of the art text-to-image models.

<hr />

## Before

__Lambda Labs__ - I worked as a Senior Machine Learning Researcher at Lambda Labs mostly with a focus on computer vision and generative models.

__MathWorks__ - I used to work as a senior consultant at MathWorks helping people to: develop computer vision and deep learning algorithms, write better MATLAB code and embrace good software development practices, develop and deploy more complex application than your average MATLAB user usually thinks about.

As part of that job I was able to release some open source projects:

- [pix2pix - Image to image translation with GANs](../matlab-pix2pix)
- [MTCNN - Deep learning face detection](../matlab-mtcnn)

__Sagentia__ - I used to work at a product development consultancy called Sagentia.

__PhD__ - Before I had a real job I did a PhD in [Biophysics](../2020/biophysics/) at the University of Oxford.
