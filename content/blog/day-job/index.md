## Lambda Labs

I currently work as a Senior Machine Learning Researcher at Lambda Labs mostly with a focus on computer vision and generative models.


<hr />

## Before

__MathWorks__ - I used to work as a senior consultant at MathWorks helping people to: develop computer vision and [[deep learning]] algorithms, write better MATLAB code and embrace good software development practices, develop and deploy more complex application than your average MATLAB user usually thinks about.

As part of that job I was able to release some open source projects:

- [[matlab-pix2pix:pix2pix - Image to image translation with GANs]]
- [[matlab-mtcnn:MTCNN - Deep learning face detection]]

__Sagentia__ - I used to work at a product development consultancy called Sagentia.

__PhD__ - Before I had a real job I did a PhD in [[Biophysics]] at the University of Oxford.
